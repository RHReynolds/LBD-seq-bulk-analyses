# Background

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repository contains analysis code for the publication found [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.22.440800v1), which applied paired bulk-tissue and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to anterior cingulate cortex samples derived from 28 individuals, including healthy controls and Lewy body disease cases.

Analyses were shared between two groups, thus code herein relates to:

- Processing and analysis bulk-tissue RNA-sequencing data
- Generate of sLDSC outputs
- Generation of manuscript figures

Code used to process and analyse single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data and to generate H-MAGMA outputs is available at: https://github.com/johnsonlab-ic/LBD-seq-singlenuc-analyses.
